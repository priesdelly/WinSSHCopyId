# üì¶üì¶üì¶ Project Archiving Notice üì¶üì¶üì¶

I am archiving this project on GitHub as it deviated from the original plan of having a single-file program. I chose the wrong technology due to my limited knowledge and insufficient research. The current release of the program is still functional, but it includes an additional DLL file. I will not be fixing any bugs or adding new features to it.

In the future, I hope to develop an ssh-copy-id tool for Windows using Go, a language I am more comfortable with. However, this will depend on my availability. In fact, I already have a private project written in Go, but it is not yet complete.

Thank you.

# WinSSHCopyId

WinSSHCopyId is a Windows application developed in C# that provides an easy way to copy SSH public keys to a remote server. This tool is particularly useful for Windows users who lack the `ssh-copy-id` utility.

## Features

- **WinForm Interface**: User-friendly graphical interface for easy SSH key management.
- **CLI Mode**: Command-line interface for advanced users.
- **C# Language**: Developed using C# for seamless integration with Windows.
- **SSH Key Management**: Automatically adds SSH public keys to the `authorized_keys` file on the remote server.

## Motivation

The motivation behind creating WinSSHCopyId is to provide Windows users with a simple and effective tool to manage SSH keys, similar to the `ssh-copy-id` utility available on Unix-based systems.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework 4.8 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or later

### Steps for Developers

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/priesdelly/WinSSHCopyId.git
    ```
2. Open the solution file `WinSSHCopyId.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore the NuGet packages and compile the project.

### Steps for Normal Users

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/priesdelly/WinSSHCopyId/releases) section of the GitHub repository.
2. Download the latest release of the application.
3. Extract the downloaded files and run `WinSSHCopyId.exe`.

## Usage
### GUI Mode
1. Run the application by executing the `WinSSHCopyId.exe` file.
2. Enter the following details in the respective fields:
    - **Host**: The hostname or IP address of the remote server.
    - **Username**: The username to log in to the remote server.
    - **Password**: The password for the username (if required).
    - **Public Key**: The SSH public key to be added to the remote server.
3. Click the `Copy` button to add the public key to the `authorized_keys` file on the remote server.

### CLI Mode
#### Basic Usage

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Run the application with the required arguments:
    ```bash
    WinSSHCopyId.exe -i <PublicKeyPath> <username>@<host>
    ```
    or in quiet mode (`-q`) (**requires password in CLI argument**):

    ```bash
    WinSSHCopyId.exe -q -i <PublicKeyPath> <username>:<password>@<host>
    ```
3. Enter the password when prompted.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use WinSSHCopyId:

### GUI Mode
1. Enter the remote server details:
    - Host: `example.com`
    - Username: `user`
    - Password: `bla bla bla password...`
    - Public Key: `ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...`
2. Click `Copy`.
3. The application will log the process in the console window, indicating whether the key was successfully added or if it already exists.

### CLI Mode
```bash
WinSSHCopyId.exe -i C:\Users\John\.ssh\id_rsa.pub john@ubuntu-linux
```
or in quiet mode (`-q`)
```bash
WinSSHCopyId.exe -q -i C:\Users\John\.ssh\id_rsa.pub john:password1234@ubuntu-linux
```
